    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person);
    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 99,
      age: 12
    });
    // object ...spread
    const cap3 = {
      ...person
    };
    cap3.name = 'Sam';

    console.log(person);
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sam = {
      name: 'sam',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@sam',
        facebook: 'sam.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(sam);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, sam);
    console.log(dev);

    // Another way:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sam));
