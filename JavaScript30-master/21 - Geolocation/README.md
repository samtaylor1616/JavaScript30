`npm i && npm start`

- We cannot fake heading and speed so we are using an IOS simulator
  - In Xcode, -> Xcode, Open Developer Tool, Simulator
  - We need to use the internal IP address in safri on the simulator

- To change location on simulator:
  - Debug, Location, then choose a location eg. freeway drive

- You can also use your safri on your computer and go to the devlop tag, then 
the simulator and use dev tools that are displayed on the phone
- Then we can use the console to check if we are getting an errors
